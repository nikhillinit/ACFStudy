## üöÄ Running Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure the development server can start: `npm run dev`
2. All dependencies installed: `npm install`
3. Playwright browsers installed: `npx playwright install`

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run tests with debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Run tests with UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# View test report after running
npm run test:e2e:report

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test home-dashboard.spec.ts

# Run tests with specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit
```

### Test Configuration

The tests are configured via `playwright.config.ts`:
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:5000`
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari
- **Auto-start**: Development server starts automatically
- **Retries**: 2 retries on CI, 0 locally
- **Screenshots**: On failure only
- **Videos**: Retained on failure
- **Traces**: On first retry

## üì± Test Strategy

### Responsive Testing
All tests include mobile viewport testing to ensure the platform works across devices:
- Desktop: 1280x720
- Mobile: 375x667 (iPhone dimensions)
- Tablet: Various iPad dimensions

### Authentication Handling
Tests gracefully handle both authenticated and non-authenticated states:
- Learning modules may require authentication
- Practice sections are accessible without auth
- AI companion features are tested in both states

### Flexible Selectors
Tests use resilient selectors that work across different UI implementations:
- Text-based selectors for user-facing content
- Data-testid attributes where available
- Semantic HTML selectors (roles, labels)
- Fallback strategies for dynamic content

## üéØ Test Scenarios

### Critical User Journeys
1. **New User Experience**
   - Landing on home page
   - Exploring learning modules
   - Starting practice problems
   - Accessing AI companion

2. **Learning Session Flow**
   - Module selection
   - Content consumption
   - Practice problem solving
   - Progress tracking

3. **Practice Intensive Session**
   - Topic selection
   - Quiz completion
   - Exam simulation
   - Calculator usage
   - Performance review

4. **AI-Assisted Learning**
   - Companion activation
   - Question asking
   - Contextual help
   - Personality customization

### Edge Cases Covered
- Network interruptions
- Authentication timeouts
- Mobile navigation
- Error page handling
- Accessibility compliance

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server binding errors on Windows:**
```bash
# If you see ENOTSUP errors, try:
$env:NODE_ENV="development"
$env:PORT="3000"
npx tsx server/index.ts
```

**Tests failing due to slow loading:**
- Increase timeout values in `playwright.config.ts`
- Add `page.waitForTimeout()` for dynamic content
- Use `page.waitForSelector()` for specific elements

**Authentication-related failures:**
- Tests handle both auth-required and open access scenarios
- Skip learning module tests if authentication wall is present
- Focus on practice flows which are generally accessible

### Test Debugging

1. **Run in headed mode** to see what's happening:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:headed
   ```

2. **Use debug mode** for step-by-step execution:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:debug
   ```

3. **Check screenshots and videos** in `test-results/` after failures

4. **Use Playwright Inspector**:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --debug
   ```

## üìä Test Reports

After running tests, view detailed reports:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:report
```

Reports include:
- Test execution summary
- Screenshots of failures
- Video recordings
- Performance metrics
- Cross-browser compatibility results

## üéØ Adding New Tests

### Test File Structure
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/relevant-page');
  });

  test('should test specific behavior', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test implementation
    await expect(page.locator('selector')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Best Practices
1. **Use descriptive test names**
2. **Handle authentication states gracefully**
3. **Include mobile testing**
4. **Use flexible selectors**
5. **Add appropriate waits for dynamic content**
6. **Test error scenarios**
7. **Verify accessibility features**

### Selector Strategy
```typescript
// Preferred order of selectors:
1. Text content: page.locator('text=Button Text')
2. Data attributes: page.locator('[data-testid="submit-btn"]')
3. Semantic HTML: page.locator('[role="button"]')
4. CSS classes: page.locator('.submit-button')
5. Complex selectors as last resort
```

## üìà Continuous Integration

Tests are configured to run in CI environments:
- **Parallel execution** disabled on CI for stability
- **Retries enabled** for flaky test resilience
- **Screenshots and videos** captured for debugging
- **Multiple browser testing** for compatibility

### Environment Variables
- `CI=true` - Enables CI-specific configurations
- `NODE_ENV=development` - Required for dev server
- `PORT=5000` - Default application port
