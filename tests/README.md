## üöÄ Running Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure the development server can start: `npm run dev`
2. All dependencies installed: `npm install`
3. Playwright browsers installed: `npx playwright install`

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run tests with debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Run tests with UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# View test report after running
npm run test:e2e:report

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test home-dashboard.spec.ts

# Run tests with specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit
```

### Test Configuration

The tests are configured via `playwright.config.ts`:
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:5000`
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari
- **Auto-start**: Development server starts automatically
- **Retries**: 2 retries on CI, 0 locally
- **Screenshots**: On failure only
- **Videos**: Retained on failure
- **Traces**: On first retry

## üì± Test Strategy

### Responsive Testing
All tests include mobile viewport testing to ensure the platform works across devices:
- Desktop: 1280x720
- Mobile: 375x667 (iPhone dimensions)
- Tablet: Various iPad dimensions

### Authentication Handling
Tests gracefully handle both authenticated and non-authenticated states:
- Learning modules may require authentication
- Practice sections are accessible without auth
- AI companion features are tested in both states

### Flexible Selectors
Tests use resilient selectors that work across different UI implementations:
- Text-based selectors for user-facing content
- Data-testid attributes where available
- Semantic HTML selectors (roles, labels)
- Fallback strategies for dynamic content

### Test Isolation
Each test runs in isolation to prevent interdependencies:
- Clean state at the beginning of each test
- Proper teardown after test completion
- No shared state between tests
- Independent fixture setup for each test case

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server binding errors on Windows:**
```bash
# If you see ENOTSUP errors, try:
$env:NODE_ENV="development"
$env:PORT="3000"
npx tsx server/index.ts
```

**Tests failing due to slow loading:**
- Increase timeout values in `playwright.config.ts`
- Add `page.waitForTimeout()` for dynamic content
- Use `page.waitForSelector()` for specific elements

**Authentication-related failures:**
- Tests handle both auth-required and open access scenarios
- Skip learning module tests if authentication wall is present
- Focus on practice flows which are generally accessible

**Flaky tests:**
- Use `test.retry()` for specific flaky tests
- Add more specific waitFor conditions
- Consider using test.slow() for complex interactions
- Check network conditions and server stability

### Test Debugging

1. **Run in headed mode** to see what's happening:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:headed
   ```

2. **Use debug mode** for step-by-step execution:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:debug
   ```

3. **Check screenshots and videos** in `test-results/` after failures

4. **Use Playwright Inspector**:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --debug
   ```

5. **Trace Viewer** for detailed step inspection:
   ```bash
   npx playwright show-trace test-results/trace.zip
   ```

## üìä Test Reports

After running tests, view detailed reports:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:report
```

Reports include:
- Test execution summary
- Screenshots of failures
- Video recordings
- Performance metrics
- Cross-browser compatibility results
- Console logs and errors
- Network request details

## üéØ Adding New Tests

### Test File Structure
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/relevant-page');
  });

  test('should test specific behavior', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test implementation
    await expect(page.locator('selector')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Best Practices
1. **Use descriptive test names**
2. **Handle authentication states gracefully**
3. **Include mobile testing**
4. **Use flexible selectors**
5. **Add appropriate waits for dynamic content**
6. **Test error scenarios**
7. **Verify accessibility features**
8. **Keep tests independent and isolated**
9. **Avoid fixed timeouts where possible**
10. **Use page object models for complex UIs**

### Selector Strategy
```typescript
// Preferred order of selectors:
1. Text content: page.locator('text=Button Text')
2. Data attributes: page.locator('[data-testid="submit-btn"]')
3. Semantic HTML: page.locator('[role="button"]')
4. CSS classes: page.locator('.submit-button')
5. Complex selectors as last resort
```

### Page Object Model Example
```typescript
// models/HomePage.ts
export class HomePage {
  constructor(private page) {}
  
  async navigate() {
    await this.page.goto('/');
  }
  
  async clickLearnModule(moduleName) {
    await this.page.locator(`[data-module="${moduleName}"]`).click();
  }
}

// In test:
const homePage = new HomePage(page);
await homePage.navigate();
await homePage.clickLearnModule('corporate-finance');
```

## üìà Continuous Integration

Tests are configured to run in CI environments:
- **Parallel execution** disabled on CI for stability
- **Retries enabled** for flaky test resilience
- **Screenshots and videos** captured for debugging
- **Multiple browser testing** for compatibility
- **Detailed reporting** for failure analysis

### Environment Variables
- `CI=true` - Enables CI-specific configurations
- `NODE_ENV=development` - Required for dev server
- `PORT=5000` - Default application port
- `PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_REPORT` - Custom report location

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
# Example workflow snippet
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
    with:
      node-version: 18
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm ci
  - name: Install Playwright browsers
    run: npx playwright install --with-deps
  - name: Run Playwright tests

## üîÑ Maintenance

Regular maintenance helps keep tests reliable:
1. **Review and update tests** with each feature change
2. **Refactor common patterns** into helper functions
3. **Run tests regularly**, not just during deployment
4. **Monitor test performance** and execution times
5. **Revisit selectors** when UI changes occur
6. **Update expected screenshots** when design changes
